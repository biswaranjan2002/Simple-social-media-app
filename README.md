This is a simple social media app that I have created using Express JS and MongoDB as Database.
You can upload texts about your interests, create your profile with your image and many more.

Features I have tried or learned here is:
  - Authorisation and Authentication
  - CRUD Operations
  - Login and Logout feature
  - Password Encryption

Only the thing is to make this work you have to download it into your local storage and on the folder terminal you have to write the command "npx nodemon app.js" as it can only run on localhosts only.

NOTE: This is my first step of learning as this repo will show my learning journey and this is the first step to it.
